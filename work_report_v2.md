| S/No. | Task number | Task Short description of task to be done | Activities A detailed description of how the task was done |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 1 | **Consolidated Semester and Course Listing Page** | 1. The `views/semester/index.php` file was updated to directly display both semester and associated course details within a single `kartik\grid\GridView`.<br>2. The search form, previously a separate conceptual step, is now integrated into the `index.php` rendering flow (via `_search.php` partial).<br>3. The `GridView` now includes columns for "Course Code", "Group Name", and "Assigned Lecturer(s)", providing a comprehensive view. |
| 2 | 2 | **Enhanced Course Allocation Actions** | 1. The single "Courses" button was replaced with a set of three distinct action buttons within the `GridView`'s `ActionColumn`.<br>2. An "Allocate" button (`assign-lecturer` class) was added, designed to trigger an in-page allocation mechanism (e.g., modal or inline form) via JavaScript.<br>3. A "Manage" button was introduced, linking to `/allocation/allocated-lecturer-render` with `purpose='manage'` for detailed management of assigned lecturers.<br>4. A "Remove" button was added, linking to `/allocation/allocated-lecturer-render` with `purpose='remove'` for removing assigned lecturers. |
| 3 | 3 | **Dynamic Filtering and Display Enhancements** | 1. New JavaScript was implemented to handle `onchange` events for academic year and programme filters, enabling dynamic page reloads with updated URL parameters.<br>2. The page now dynamically displays contextual information such as the selected academic year, degree code, degree name, level of study, and semester code above the `GridView`.<br>3. The "Assigned Lecturer(s)" column now visually distinguishes between a course "Leader" and other assigned lecturers. |
| 4 | 4 | **Backend Search Model Adaptation** | 1. The `SemesterSearch` model (or its underlying query logic) was adapted to fetch and provide both semester and associated course data directly to the `GridView`.<br>2. The search model was updated to support filtering by course code, course name, and assigned lecturers, reflecting the new display capabilities of the `GridView`. |
| 5 | 5 | **Lecturer's Personal Course Allocation View (`actionAllocation`)** | 1. Implemented a new public action `actionAllocation()` in `AllocationController.php`.<br>2. This action utilizes a new `CourseAssignmentSearch` model to retrieve course assignments for the logged-in lecturer.<br>3. It performs separate searches for non-supplementary, supplementary, and all courses based on academic year and semester type.<br>4. Includes logic to display a flash message if no courses are found for the current academic year.<br>5. Renders a dedicated `allocation` view, passing relevant data providers and filters for display. |
| 6 | 6 | **Dynamic Retrieval of Lecturer's Programmes (`getUserProgrammes`)** | 1. Developed a new private helper method `getUserProgrammes()` within `AllocationController.php`.<br>2. This method is designed to extract and return unique academic programmes associated with a lecturer's course assignments.<br>3. It can process programmes directly from a provided `dataProvider` (e.g., from `actionAllocation`) or, conceptually, fetch them directly from the database (though the direct database query is currently commented out). |
