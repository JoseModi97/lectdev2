| 1 | 1 | **Project Setup and Core Data Modeling** | 1. Initialized a new Yii2 application project.<br>2. Designed and implemented the database schema for `Semesters`, `Courses`, `DegreeProgrammes`, `Groups`, `MarksheetDef`, and `AllocationRequests` tables.<br>3. Generated or manually created corresponding Yii2 Active Record models (e.g., `Semester.php`, `Course.php`, `DegreeProgramme.php`, `MarksheetDef.php`, `AllocationRequest.php`) to interact with the database. |
| 2 | 2 | **Semester Listing and Filtering Module Development** | 1. Created `SemesterController` with an `actionIndex` method to serve as the entry point for the semester listing page.<br>2. Developed `views/semester/index.php` to display semesters using the `kartik\grid\GridView` widget, enabling features like sorting and pagination.<br>3. Created `views/semester/_search.php` as a partial view to house the semester filtering form.<br>4. Implemented `Select2` widgets in `_search.php` for user-friendly selection of "Academic Year" and "Degree Code".<br>5. Added JavaScript/AJAX logic to `_search.php` to dynamically update the "Degree Code" dropdown options based on the selected "Academic Year" by calling a dedicated `actionDegcode` in `SemesterController`.<br>6. Developed `app/models/search/SemesterSearch.php` to encapsulate the search and filtering logic for the `GridView`. |
| 3 | 3 | **Integration of Course Allocation Navigation** | 1. Configured an `ActionColumn` within the `kartik\grid\GridView` in `views/semester/index.php`.<br>2. Added a "Courses" button to each row of the semester grid.<br>3. Programmed the button to generate a dynamic URL using `Url::to(['allocation/give', ...])`, passing the specific `academicYear`, `degreeCode`, `levelOfStudy`, `group`, and `semester` parameters from the selected row, along with a `purpose` parameter. |
| 4 | 4 | **Backend Course Allocation Logic Implementation** | 1. Created `AllocationController` to manage course allocation processes.<br>2. Implemented the `actionGive` method in `AllocationController` to handle requests from the "Courses" button.<br>3. Within `actionGive`, developed logic to retrieve and validate `CourseAllocationFilter` parameters from the GET request and store them in the session for persistence.<br>4. Implemented conditional logic to instantiate either `MarksheetDefAllocationSearchNew` or `AllocationRequestsSearchNew` models based on the `purpose` filter.<br>5. Used the selected search model to fetch and prepare the relevant course data.<br>6. Implemented conditional rendering to display either `coursesToAllocate` or `requestedCourses` views based on the `purpose` parameter, presenting the list of courses for allocation. |
